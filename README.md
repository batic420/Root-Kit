# Root-Kit

---

### Intro

This Project is built because i wanted a secure & efficient working backend for my api's. The goal was to set a base from where i can start building up application code. As i wanted to work on my skills especially in the backend area with typescript i've created this project to fully understand my projects, relations & stuff like this.

### Basics

The API works with express.js a powerful framework which takes control over routing the responses & requests. Additionaly it's very easy to understand when dealing with it for a longer time. I've learned much about it while i was working on the basics of my API.

Also I wanted to rank security at a very high point, so I can ensure when working with the Root-Kit, every traffic is routed secure & the way I intended it to. So I've added a firewall (CORS) which doesn't needs much code to take care of my endpoints.

Furthermore I'm proud of my database integration - when setting up the Root-Kit a mysql-db named `root_kit` will be created for you. It contains a single table named `user` which will be used for the default endpoints to signUp & create your first users for your application. I also wanted Root-Kit to be as flexible as possible so i also added the option to easily set up your own db like postgre, sqlite, ...
For this task, I implemented a terminal integration to Root-Kit. You can simply use `root-kit --help` to see all working commands you can use. In this list you also will be able to integrate your own db with ease.

### Vision

My vision for Root-Kit is that it can be used for setting up backend API's very easily & just with a few clicks (or commands in the terminal ^^) - so every developer can prioritize his application development before setting up a base from where he can start. Every API starts at the same level & also error handling won't be a big deal when working with Root-Kit.

### Conclusion

I hope you have a lot of fun when dealing with Root-Kit, or have a good start when learning backend development with TypeScript!
